    <h1><strong>The NFL Draft: calculated maneuvers or blind faith?</strong></h1>
    	<p class="lead">Once a year, NFL teams have the opportunity to acquire young, talented players for a reasonable price tag. General manangers have a laundry list of responsibilies, but the annual infusion of youth can be used as a measuring stick for their success.</p>

					<h3>An Overview</h3>
					<p><i>With the 1st overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, the Jacksonville Jaguars select Trevor Lawrence, quarterback, Clemson.</i></p>
					<p>And so began three days of madness in Cleveland, Ohio, where 32 NFL teams took their pick of incoming players to add to their teams. The NFL Draft has become a public spectacle in recent years, the completely virtual 2020 draft set the record for TV viewership.</p>
					<p>Back at team offices, executives do their best to choose who they project to be the future of the league. Some teams have more success doing so than others, which tends to lead to more success for those franchises.</p>
					<p>Succeeding in the draft makes life a lot easier for NFL front offices. Since the players drafted are on more affordable contracts, the money saved can be spent on retaining the best players on the team or going out and signing talented free agents on the open market.</p>
					<p>A perfect example of this is Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. Wilson was drafted in the 3rd round in 2012, and was being paid less than one million dollars when he led the Seahawks to Super Bowl appearances in both 2012 and 2013. Instead of having to spend north of $30 million for a top quarterback in the league, Seattle was able to spend more money on important positions like a Pro Bowl secondary of Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor, and Earl Thomas. Because of this, the ‘Legion of Boom’ Seattle defense was the best unit in the NFL for four straight seasons.</p>
					<p>The NFL Draft is imperfect. Sometimes players expected to work out don't and players who started as an afterthoguht become stars.</p>
					<p>As Connor King, a sport management student at St. John Fisher College put it, “If one were to analyze the history of the draft, there would be many instances to suggest evidence that general managers either looked like geniuses or looked completely clueless due to the success or lack of success of their draft picks.”</p>

		<h2><b><center>The case for each</center></b></h2>

		<p class="explain"><i>Before diving too deep into the numbers on team's draft success and on-the-field success, it's important to understand the two different avenues for acquring talent in the NFL: the draft and free agency.</i></p>

		<br>

		<div class="container-fluid">
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3><center>The Draft</center></h3>
					<p>As prefaced in the beginning, the draft is a great way to improve a football team. If a team has a high hit rate on their draft picks, the money saved can be used to hand out bigger contracts to the team's best players, who need new deals after their contracts run out. But not every team succeeds in the draft. Not every player selected pans out.</p>
					<p><a href="https://mgoblog.com/diaries/round-and-longevity-another-look-nfl-career-length">In data collected between 1995 and 2007</a>, the average career of a first round pick was close to 8 years. A second round pick's drops to six and a half, and a fifth round pick's is just a hair above four years. The "hit rate" on players falls significantly after first round picks, and even those players aren't always guaranteed to pan out. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2017/draft.htm">Of the players drafted in 2017</a>, who are all currently, or would be, in the final years of their rookie contracts, just 53% remain with the team that drafted them.</p>
					<p>But the great teams also hit on picks outside of the first round. “Day two is where you’re trying to find starter-level talent. A second round pick and a third round pick are real assets.” says PJ CLark, who works for the Detroit Lions.</p>
					<p>When done correctly though, the draft is the more efficient of the two for the reasons listed above. Cheap players who <i>sometimes</i> quickly ascend to being some of the best in the league is what keeps the NFL fresh and exciting. The issue is, a lot of teams struggle finding those players and it shows in their win percentage.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<h3><center>Free Agency</center></h3>
					<p>The other avenue for player acquisition is free agency. Once a player’s rookie contract expires, he becomes a free agent the following offseason. This gives other teams an opportunity to essentially bid for a player’s services, something they wouldn’t have had the chance to do until their rookie contract had expired. As a result, the price tag increases because more than one team wants that guy on their team.</p>
					<p>There’s also a de facto “market” established by past contracts around the league. Players and their agents use recent contracts signed by players of the same position and similar skill level to negotiate how much they should be paid. Philadelphia tight end Dallas Goedert got his $14 million per year contract based on other top tight ends making a <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/contracts/sort-average/tight-end/limit-100/">similar amount.</a> So while contracts aren’t as predetermined as they are for players who are drafted, there is still some structure to their creation.</p>
					<p>Contracts signed in free agency, at least by the top players, are much more lucrative than the ones that are signed when a player first enters the league. In theory, you’re paying more money for premium talent because the player is proven and you know what you’re getting.</p>

  			<div class="card card-body"><p>The NFL Draft order is decided by reverse order of the previous season's standings. Whichever team finishes with the worst record in the league is granted the #1 pick, and whichever team wins the Super Bowl picks #32. This order applies to rounds 1-7. Teams are also granted what are called compensatory picks based on players that left to sign with a different team. Those picks fall between rounds 3-7. All of the picks allocated for each draft add up to 259 total selections.<p><p>Click here to see the NFL Draft order if the season were to end today: <a href="https://www.tankathon.com/nfl">https://www.tankathon.com/nfl</a></p></div>

				<p>There’s no denying that free agency is exciting. Big name players hit the open market and get the chance to choose what team they want to play for, which, for some, is the first time they’ve been able to do so since committing to a college. But the draft can be far more efficient, and therefore is more important.</p>
				<p>So much so that teams have entire sections of their scouting department dedicated to a region of college football teams. For example, a specific scout will attend games in the southeast and become an expert on those players, that way, come draft time, they’re much more knowledgeable about a group rather than knowing very little about everyone.</p>
				<p>“Some teams even have a guy that looks a year ahead … When people are focusing on last year’s class after the draft in April, they’re already looking at who could declare for the next year.” says PJ Clark.</p>
				<p>But the draft is very much an imperfect science. Old-school, "eye-test” scouts clash with scouts who favor the numbers and analytics. Different front offices favor different things in players, which results in some teams doing better than others. Most of the time, the teams that have the most success drafting look at players strictly in a talent sense. Other factors like scheme fit, injury history, and potential come into play, but it’s hard to go wrong with taking the best player available.</p>
				<p>“I think a lot of people ignore production in favor of traits … there are guys that go out there and produce wherever they play,” says Clark. “For some reason, people think the minute they step on an NFL field, all of the sudden they’re not going to be able to play football anymore because maybe they did it at a lower level of competition.”</p>
				<p>It seems simple, but a lot of teams still struggle with the concept. Draft good players, win games.</p>
